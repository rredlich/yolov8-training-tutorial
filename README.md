# YOLOv8 Training Tutorial

YOLOv8 is a computer vision model built by Ultralytics which support object detection, classification, key-point detection, and segmentation tasks.

In this tutorial we will fine-tunne the YOLOv8 nano model on a open source custom dataset to detect wood defects.

The dataset was made by Makar Baderko, and it is store on [Universe Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/makar-baderko-kv1k2/plywood).
